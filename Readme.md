## DECENTRALIZED-ELECTION-SYSTEM DAO
We will use Blockchain and automate online voting system uses facial recognition 
technology to authenticate voters and ensure that each person can only cast one vote. 
Voters are presented with a list of candidates for their electoral district, and after successful 
mining, the Blockchain incorporates votes by adding them as a new block. The system 
relies on cryptographic hashes for end-to-end verification and achieves voter privacy by 
sending a notification with a unique voters ID to the voter without revealing how they 
voted. The individual hash of every voter remains concealed and inaccessible to anyone, 
including the system operator or administrator. The system ensures verifiability of the 
voting process while maintaining individual voter privacy and the potential 
for increased transparency and security in the voting process by eliminating the need for 
intermediaries, reducing the risk of manipulation, and ensuring the integrity of the results 
through smart contracts


## WHY DAO?
A DAO is a community-driven decentralized autonomous organisation.
It will help us achieve impartiality delegating the duties of the citizens and social causes.
We will use the dao to fund protests, manage protests and civic demos and communically manage our operations.


## STACK 

1. Consensus Layer (Protocol):

This is the foundation of the system and defines how votes are validated and added to the network. Examples include blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, or Hyperledger Fabric. </br>
2. Data Layer:</br>

This layer deals with storing and retrieving data in a decentralized manner. Options include InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for permanent storage and Filecoin for incentivized storage solutions.
3. Contract Layer:</br>

This layer allows for the creation of self-executing contracts, known as smart contracts. Popular smart contract languages include Solidity (Ethereum), Rust (Solana), and Chaincode (Hyperledger Fabric).</br>
4. Application Layer:</br>

This layer focuses on building user-facing applications that interact with the decentralized protocols and data. Developers can leverage libraries and frameworks like React or Angular for front-end development, and Web3.js or Ethers.js for interacting with blockchains.
5. Incentive Layer (Optional):</br>

In some decentralized systems, there might be a layer dedicated to providing economic incentives to users who participate in the network. This can be achieved through staking mechanisms or token rewards.
Additional Considerations:</br>

Identity Management: Decentralized Identity (DID) solutions can be used to manage user identities without relying on centralized authorities.</br>
Scalability Solutions: As decentralized systems grow, scalability becomes a concern. Layer 2 solutions or sidechains can be used to address this challenge.
